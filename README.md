## Getting started

Clone the repository or download all files and open _index.html_.

## Features

* Programming: drag blocks from the **Blocks** menu to the workspace. Execute the program with the green or red run button.
  * The green run button steps through the code.
  * The red run button continuously executes the code. Interrupting an infinite loop is not possible. Save the program to avoid losing it. 
* Navigation: Zoom and center.
* View the corresponding JavaScript code.
* Save the current program to an _.xml_ file and load a program from xml
* Change the language.

## About
